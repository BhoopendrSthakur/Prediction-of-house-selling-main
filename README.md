# House Selling Price Prediction Using Multivariate Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that forecasts house selling prices based on various factors such as age, number of hot rooms, and rainfall using multivariate linear regression. The dataset used for this analysis includes different features affecting house prices.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze the relationship between various factors affecting house prices and to develop a model that accurately predicts house selling prices based on these factors.

## Data

The dataset used is the house price dataset which contains features such as:
- **Age** of the house
- **Number of hot rooms** in the house
- **Rainfall** in the area
- **Proximity to airport**
- **Proximity to water bodies**
- **Proximity to bus terminals**

## Steps Involved

1. **Reading and Understanding the Data:**
   - Importing necessary libraries
   - Loading the dataset
   - Initial data inspection and cleaning

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Outlier detection and treatment
   - Visualizing relationships between features and target variable

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering and transformation
   - Encoding categorical variables

4. **Model Building:**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Building and evaluating various models (Linear Regression, LDA, KNN)
   - Tuning model hyperparameters

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Testing the models on the test dataset
   - Comparing predicted values with actual house prices
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix
